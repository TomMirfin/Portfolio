 After working in the hospitality industry for over ten years I
              decided it was time for a change. I have always been interested in
              technology and how it works, so I decided to take the plunge,
              started working part time and set out learning how to code. Fast
              forward eight months and I have been on a coding journey
              culminating in a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp at
             Northcoders , which is due
              to finish in January.

              During my time of self-study I have focussed on learning, Javascript, CSS, && React.

                Outside of coding I enjoy attempting to play Golf 🏌🏻 , Bouldering
              🧗‍♂️, Running 👟 and supporting Middlesbrough Football Club 🔴
              (someone Has To).
